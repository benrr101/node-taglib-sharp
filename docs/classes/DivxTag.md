## Accessors

### album

• `get` **album**(): `string`

Gets the album of the media represented by the current instance. For video media, this
represents the collection the video belongs to.

This field represents the name of the album the media belongs to. In the case of a
boxed set, it should be the name of the entire set rather than the individual disc. In
the case of a series, this should be the name of the series, rather than the season of a
series.

For example, "Kintsugi" (an album by Death Cab for Cutie), "The Complete Red Green Show"
(a boxed set of TV episodes), or "Shark Tank" (a series with several seasons).

#### Returns

`string`

Album of the media represented by the current instance or `undefined` if no value
    is present

#### Inherited from

Tag.album

• `set` **album**(`value`): `void`

Sets the album of the media represented by the current instance. For video media, this
represents the collection the video belongs to.

This field represents the name of the album the media belongs to. In the case of a
boxed set, it should be the name of the entire set rather than the individual disc. In
the case of a series, this should be the name of the series, rather than the season of a
series.

For example, "Kintsugi" (an album by Death Cab for Cutie), "The Complete Red Green Show"
(a boxed set of TV episodes), or "Shark Tank" (a series with several seasons).

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `value` | `string` | of the media represented by the current instance or `undefined` if no value is present |

### albumArtists

• `get` **albumArtists**(): `string`[]

Gets the band or artist who is credited in the creation of the entire album or
collection containing the media described by the current instance.

This field is typically optional but aids in the sorting of compilations or albums
with multiple artist. For example, if an album has several artists, sorting by artist
will split up albums by the same artist. Having a single album artist for an entire
album solves this problem.
As this value is to be used as a sorting key, it should be used with less variation
than [performers](DivxTag.md#performers). Where performers can be broken into multiple artists, it is
best to stick to a single name. Eg, "Super8 & Tab"

#### Returns

`string`[]

Band or artist credited with the creation of the entire album or collection
    containing the media described by the current instance or an empty array if no value is
    present

#### Inherited from

Sets the bands or artists who are credited in the creation of the entire album or
collection containing the media described by the current instance.

"Folds, Ben".
As this value is to be used as a sorting key, it should be used with less variation than
[performers](DivxTag.md#performers). Where [performers](DivxTag.md#performers) can be broken into multiple performers, it is
best to stick to a single album artist. Eg, "Van Buuren, Armin"

Tag.year

• `set` **year**(`value`): `void`

Sets the year that the media represented by the current instance was recorded.

Years greater than 9999 cannot be stored by most tagging formats and will be cleared
if a higher value is set. Some tagging formats store higher precision dates which will
be truncated when this property is set. Format specific implementations are necessary to
access the higher precision values.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `value` | `number` | Year that the media represented by the current instance was created or `0` if no value is present. |

#### Returns

`void`

#### Overrides

Tag.year

## Methods

### clear

▸ **clear**(): `void`

Clears all values stored in the current instance.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Overrides

[Tag](Tag.md).[clear](Tag.md#clear)

___

### copyTo

▸ **copyTo**(`target`, `overwrite`): `void`

Copies the values from the current instance to another [Tag](Tag.md), optionally overwriting
existing values.

This method only copies the most basic values when copying between different tag
formats. However, if `target` is of the same type as the current instance,
more advanced copying may be done. For example if both `this` and `target` are
[Id3v2Tag](Id3v2Tag.md), all frames will be copied to the target.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `target` | [`Tag`](Tag.md) | Target tag to copy values to |
| `overwrite` | `boolean` | Whether or not to copy values over existing ones |

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[Tag](Tag.md).[copyTo](Tag.md#copyto)

___

### render

▸ **render**(): [`ByteVector`](ByteVector.md)

Renders the current instance as a raw DivX tag.

#### Returns

[`ByteVector`](ByteVector.md)

___

### firstInGroup

▸ `Static` `Protected` **firstInGroup**(`group`): `string`

Gets the first string in an array.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `group` | `string`[] | Array of strings to get the first string from. |

#### Returns

`string`

First string contained in `group` or `undefined` if the array is
    `undefined` or empty

#### Inherited from

[Tag](Tag.md).[firstInGroup](Tag.md#firstingroup)

___

### fromData

▸ `Static` **fromData**(`data`): [`DivxTag`](DivxTag.md)

Constructs and initializes a new instance by reading the raw tag data stored in a specified
[ByteVector](ByteVector.md) object.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `data` | [`ByteVector`](ByteVector.md) | [ByteVector](ByteVector.md) that contains the raw tag data |

#### Returns

[`DivxTag`](DivxTag.md)

___

### fromEmpty

▸ `Static` **fromEmpty**(): [`DivxTag`](DivxTag.md)

Constructs and initializes a new instance with no contents.

#### Returns

[`DivxTag`](DivxTag.md)

___

### isFalsyOrLikeEmpty

▸ `Static` `Protected` **isFalsyOrLikeEmpty**(`value`): `boolean`

Checks if a value is falsy or empty.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `value` | `string` \| `string`[] | Object to check |

#### Returns

`boolean`

If `value` is a string, `true` is returned if the value is falsy or all
    whitespace, `false` is returned otherwise. If `value` is an array of strings,
    the array must be falsy or all elements must be falsy or whitespace to return `true`.

#### Inherited from

[Tag](Tag.md).[isFalsyOrLikeEmpty](Tag.md#isfalsyorlikeempty)

___

### joinGroup

▸ `Static` `Protected` **joinGroup**(`group`): `string`

Joins an array of string into a single, semicolon and space separated string.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `group` | `string`[] | Array of string to join |

#### Returns

`string`

A semicolon and space separated string containing the values from `group`
    or undefined if the array is `undefined` or empty.

#### Inherited from

[Tag](Tag.md).[joinGroup](Tag.md#joingroup)

___

### tagTypeFlagsToArray

▸ `Static` **tagTypeFlagsToArray**(`tagTypes`): [`TagTypes`](../enums/TagTypes.md)[]

Generates an array of tag types that are set in the provided flags value.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `tagTypes` | [`TagTypes`](../enums/TagTypes.md) | Tag types that have been OR'd together. |

#### Returns

[`TagTypes`](../enums/TagTypes.md)[]

#### Inherited from
