# Class: FlacTag

Collection of tags that can be stored in a FLAC file.

**`Remarks`**

The FLAC file specification states that tagging should be done via a XIPH comment block
    and any pictures should be stored in a FLAC picture block. However, tagging can be done via
    ID3 and APE tags at the beginning or end of the file, same as MP3 and other files. This
    class provides a unified interface into all the tags a FLAC file may contain.

## Accessors

### album

• `get` **album**(): `string`

Gets the album of the media represented by the current instance. For video media, this
represents the collection the video belongs to.

This field represents the name of the album the media belongs to. In the case of a
boxed set, it should be the name of the entire set rather than the individual disc. In
the case of a series, this should be the name of the series, rather than the season of a
series.

For example, "Kintsugi" (an album by Death Cab for Cutie), "The Complete Red Green Show"
(a boxed set of TV episodes), or "Shark Tank" (a series with several seasons).

#### Returns

`string`

#### Inherited from

CombinedTag.album

• `set` **album**(`val`): `void`

Sets the album of the media represented by the current instance. For video media, this
represents the collection the video belongs to.

This field represents the name of the album the media belongs to. In the case of a
boxed set, it should be the name of the entire set rather than the individual disc. In
the case of a series, this should be the name of the series, rather than the season of a
series.

For example, "Kintsugi" (an album by Death Cab for Cutie), "The Complete Red Green Show"
(a boxed set of TV episodes), or "Shark Tank" (a series with several seasons).

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `val` | `string` | of the media represented by the current instance or `undefined` if no value is present |

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

### albumArtists

• `get` **albumArtists**(): `string`[]

Gets the band or artist who is credited in the creation of the entire album or
collection containing the media described by the current instance.

This field is typically optional but aids in the sorting of compilations or albums
with multiple artist. For example, if an album has several artists, sorting by artist
will split up albums by the same artist. Having a single album artist for an entire
album solves this problem.
As this value is to be used as a sorting key, it should be used with less variation
than [performers](FlacTag.md#performers). Where performers can be broken into multiple artists, it is
best to stick to a single name. Eg, "Super8 & Tab"

#### Returns

`string`[]

#### Inherited from

CombinedTag.albumArtists

• `set` **albumArtists**(`val`): `void`

Sets the bands or artists who are credited in the creation of the entire album or

___

### clear

▸ **clear**(): `void`

Clears all values stored in the current instance.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Overrides

[CombinedTag](CombinedTag.md).[clear](CombinedTag.md#clear)

___

### copyTo

▸ **copyTo**(`target`, `overwrite`): `void`

Copies the values from the current instance to another [Tag](Tag.md), optionally overwriting
existing values.

This method only copies the most basic values when copying between different tag
formats. However, if `target` is of the same type as the current instance,
more advanced copying may be done. For example if both `this` and `target` are
[Id3v2Tag](Id3v2Tag.md), all frames will be copied to the target.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `target` | [`Tag`](Tag.md) | Target tag to copy values to |
| `overwrite` | `boolean` | Whether or not to copy values over existing ones |

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[CombinedTag](CombinedTag.md).[copyTo](CombinedTag.md#copyto)

___

### createTag

▸ **createTag**(`tagType`, `copy`): [`Tag`](Tag.md)

Creates a new instance of the desired tag type and adds it to the current instance. If the
tag type is unsupported in the current context or the tag type already exists, an error will
be thrown.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `tagType` | [`TagTypes`](../enums/TagTypes.md) | Type of tag to create |
| `copy` | `boolean` | Whether or not to copy the contents of the current instance to the newly created tag instance |

#### Returns

[`Tag`](Tag.md)

#### Overrides

[CombinedTag](CombinedTag.md).[createTag](CombinedTag.md#createtag)

___

### getTag

▸ **getTag**<`TTag`\>(`tagType`): `TTag`

Gets a tag of the specified tag type if a matching tag exists in the current instance.

#### Type parameters

| Name | Type |
| :------ | :------ |

| `tagType` | [`TagTypes`](../enums/TagTypes.md) | Type of tag to retrieve |

#### Returns

`TTag`

Tag with specified type, if it exists. `undefined` otherwise.

___

### removeTags

▸ **removeTags**(`tagTypes`): `void`

Remove all tags that match the specified tagTypes. This is performed recursively. Any nested
`CombinedTag` instances are left in place.

#### Parameters

### validateTagCreation

▸ `Protected` **validateTagCreation**(`tagType`): `void`

Verifies if a tag can be added to the current instance. The criteria for validation are:
* A tag of the given tag type does not already exist
* The given tag type is supported by the current instance

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `tagType` | [`TagTypes`](../enums/TagTypes.md) | Tag type that the caller wants to create |

Gets the first string in an array.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
