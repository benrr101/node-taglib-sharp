## Description
TagLib# is a .NET library that has been around for years. It provides a unified interface for
accessing metadata from a vast selection of media files. Until now there hasn't been a port of this
library for Node.js. This project is a mostly wholesale translation of the original TagLib#.

Note: A port of TagLib already exists for Node.js. Despite TagLib being the origin of TabLib#, it
is substantially lacking in the variety of media formats that can be handled. TagLib# greatly
improved on the original TagLib, hence why this project exists

## Supported Formats
